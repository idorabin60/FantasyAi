Return exactly one of: - \"will start\" - \"will not start\" - \"might not start\"\nIf there is no Champions League match for his team today or tomorrow, you must answer \"might not start\" and clearly say that the team does not play a UCL match in that 2-day window.\n\nYou ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:\n\nTool Name: Search the internet with Serper\nTool Arguments: {'search_query': {'description': 'Mandatory search query you want to use to search the internet', 'type': 'str'}}\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to search the internet with a search_query.
