get_player_status_task:
  description: >
    Determine the status of player {player_name} in the Sport5 fantasy league
    for today's date: {current_date}, **only for a Champions League game
    that is played TODAY or TOMORROW**.

    The status MUST be exactly one of:
    - "will start"
    - "will not start"
    - "might not start"

    VERY IMPORTANT:
    1) First, identify if {player_name}'s team has a Champions League match
       scheduled for today ({current_date}) or tomorrow (the next calendar day).
    2) If there is NO such match (for example, the next UCL match is in 5 days,
       or the last UCL match was yesterday), you MUST return:
       - status: "might not start"
       - reason: explain that there is no UCL game today or tomorrow.
    3) If there IS a UCL match today or tomorrow, you MUST:
       - check predicted lineups and/or official lineups for that exact match,
       - verify the date in the article matches the match date,
       - check very recent injury/suspension/rotation news.

    You MUST NOT:
    - Use lineups or previews for past Champions League matches as if they are
      about today's/tomorrow's match.
    - Use generic season statistics to guess a status.

    If official lineups are already available, you should base the status
    directly on them. Otherwise, use multiple recent predicted XI sources.

  expected_output: >
    Return a JSON object with the following fields:

    {
      "status": "<one of 'will start' | 'will not start' | 'might not start'>",
      "reason": "<2–6 sentences explaining the decision. Explicitly mention
                  the UCL match date and whether it is today or tomorrow.>",
      "sources": ["<URL1>", "<URL2>", "..."],
      "as_of": "<ISO timestamp when you made this decision, e.g. '2025-12-09T19:45:00+03:00'>"
    }

    - If there is no UCL match for the player's team today or tomorrow,
      the reason MUST clearly say: "There is no Champions League match
      for [team] on {current_date} or the following day."
    - Always state which fixture you are talking about, with the opponent
      and the date (e.g., "Atalanta vs Chelsea on 2025-12-09").
